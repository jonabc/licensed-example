#/ WARNING: Do not call this directly. Please create packages using
#/ `script/package [platform]` or `bundle exec rake package[platform]`
#/
#/ Builds a distributable package for licensed for a given RUBYC compiler and licensed VERSION.
#/ Packages are of the form licensed-$VERSION-$PLATFORM-x64.tar.gz and contain a `./licensed` executable
#/ Built Packages are placed in the <root>/pkg/$VERSION directory.
#/
#/ OPTIONS:
#/   <RUBYC>           The path to a rubyc compiler that should be used to compile the target executable
#/   [VERSION]         (optional, default to current git branch or SHA1) version of licensed to build exe at

#/ EXAMPLES:
#/
#/   Builds a package for version 1.1.0 using a local rubyc compiler
#/     $ script/packages/build RUBYC="./rubyc-darwin" VERSION="1.1.0"
